            <p>6.1 When you place an Order with BookHub, BookHub will confirm your order by sending you a confirmation email containing the Order receipt. Where applicable, Orders will include delivery fees and any applicable tax (e.g. goods and services tax, value-added tax, etc.). <br> 
    
                6.2 Minimum Order Value - Some of our Vendors require a minimum order value (“MOV”) before an Order can be placed and delivered to you. Where an applicable Order fails to meet the MOV, you will have the option of paying the difference to meet the MOV or to add more Goods to your Order.<br>
                
                6.3 Special Instructions – BookHub and the Vendor (as the case may be) reasonably endeavour to comply with your special instructions for an Order. However in some cases where this is not feasible, possible or commercially reasonable, BookHub and/or the Vendor reserve the right to proceed to prepare the Order in accordance with standard operating procedures. Neither BookHub nor the Vendor shall be responsible to replace or refund an Order which does not conform to special instructions provided by you.<br>
                
                6.4 Allergens – BookHub is not obligated to provide ingredient information or allergen information on the Platforms. Further, BookHub does not guarantee that the Goods sold by Vendors are free of allergens. If you have allergies, allergic reactions or dietary restrictions and requirements, please contact the Vendor before placing an Order on our Platforms.<br>
                
                6.5 Please note that your Order may be subject to additional terms and conditions provided by the Vendor.<br> 
                
                6.6 Prior to placing the Order.<br>

                6.7 Placing the Order <br>
                
                To complete an Order, please follow the onscreen instructions after clicking ‘Checkout’. You may be required to provide additional details for us to complete your Order. You are required to review and confirm that all the information you provide, including the amounts, delivery details, personal details, payment information, and voucher codes (if applicable) is true, accurate and complete before you click “PLACE ORDER”. An Order is successfully placed when you receive an email confirmation containing your Order receipt from us.<br>
                
                6.8 Cancelling an Order <br>
                
                6.8.1 Please contact us immediately via our in-app customer support chat feature if you wish to cancel your Order after it has been placed. You have the right to cancel your Order provided a Vendor has not yet accepted your Order.<br> 
                
                6.8.2 Refunds <br>
                
                (i) Online Payment Orders <br>
                
                You have the right to a refund for a cancelled Order only if a Vendor has not yet accepted your Order. Should you still decide to cancel your Order after it has been accepted by the Vendor, you understand that no refunds (whether in whole or in part) will be issued to you and you forfeit the delivery of your cancelled Order.<br> 
                
                (ii) Cash-on-Delivery Orders <br>
                
                You have the right to cancel your Order only if a Vendor has not yet accepted your Order. Should you still decide to cancel your Order after it has been accepted by the Vendor, you understand that you shall forfeit the delivery of your cancelled Order and cash-on-delivery may be removed from your list of available payment methods for your future orders.<br>
                
                6.9 BookHub reserves the right to cancel any Order and/or suspend, deactivate or terminate your BookHub account in its sole discretion if it reasonably suspects or detects fraudulent behavior or activity associated with your BookHub account and/or with your Order. 20.1 The purchase of Goods from Vendors on ‘SHOPS’ on the Platforms, including PandaNow (“SHOPS”) are subject to these Terms. Additionally, you agree to comply with any and all the guidelines, notices, operating rules and policies and instructions pertaining to the purchase of Goods from SHOPS which are incorporated into and form a part of these Terms. <br>

                20.2 Due to delivery constraints, BookHub may be required to impose a cap on the amount of your Order or limit the quantities of Goods in your Order from SHOPS in its sole discretion.<br>
                
                20.3 Unless otherwise stated, all purchases from SHOPS shall be subject to the SHOPS cancellation, refund and returns policy.<br> 
                
                20.4 Where the prices of any Goods are subject to the definitive weight of the Goods, we will provide an initial estimate of the price for the purposes of checkout. The final price shall be indicated in your email confirmation containing your tax invoice. For shortfalls in payment, additional amounts shall be charged to you. For overpayments, excess amounts shall be refunded in accordance with our SHOPS cancellation, refund and returns policy. <br>
                
                20.5 We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to restrict or limit the sales of our Goods to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction. Due to the laws in some countries, we shall not offer for sale certain goods, or restricted items to you (e.g. alcohol, tobacco, etc.). Any offer for any Goods made on the Platforms is void when it is prohibited by law.</p>
